# ChatApp-with-Chatbot-Implementation

A maven project Chatroom for anonymous users with Chatbot Implementation, coupled with googled searching from Jsoup parsing. Maybe I would migrate to gradle some day.

Clone & Import it into your IDE as a maven project. Maybe add Ab.jar as an external jar if there is any error in JapaneseUtil classes.

Also, in chatbot.java, change the resource path to the directory containing the bots folder.

Deploy on tomcat 9.0 or above.

As long as the server is running, so is the bot's chatsession. After mentioning your email, you can write 'transcript' to send the chat transcript to your email(The sender is my test mail, so please make sure to change that).
